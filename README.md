# Fortran LIBS

Fortran libraries developed for personal usage, aimed at both being a standalone Fortran library and also to be used with `f2py` for Python usage.

Build the shared library for your system using `make`. The requirements are having `f2py` (from a Python 3 NumPy installation) and `gfortran` reachable from the command line. This software always targets the latest version of Python and NumPy.
